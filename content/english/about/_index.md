We are a group of AI and cloud enthusiasts who believe these technologies shouldn't be out of reach for normal people. As a company, we have been around for a while, mainly on the consulting side providing [enterprise AI and Cloud solutions](https://hazl.ca). We saw the need for making these technologies more accessible. That's why we built this platform -- the first ever AI-operated cloud platform. We believe we are on a mission to bring AI and cloud technology to benefit not just the established businesses, but individuals who need it.
